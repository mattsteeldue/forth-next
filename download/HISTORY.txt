\ build 20200514
First working  DOSCALL that uses NEXTZXOS primitives.


\ build 20200529
Tentative project branch to use IX as return-stack-pointer (RP).
This test show that there is no speed nor room improvement in using IX instead of a fixed memory location.
More, I found IX useful as a spare couple of register.


\ build 20200608
SP register to be below C000 in  INKEY  and  SELECT  too.
Removed  floating-point primitives to save room.
LOAD  now can be interrupted using Break 


\ build 20200619
Changed behaviour of  WORD  to return the value of HERE 
Removed  CALL#   from core and left only in Blocks library 
Replacing  DO  with  ?DO  in  TYPE  and  SPACES
Introducing  PICK  at  Scr# 270
Fixed  ?STACK  to ignore errors when DP is beyond S0: purpose is to use higher 8K RAM as vocabulary extension.


\ build 20200624
Removed  MOVE-SP,  MOVE-RP,  MOVE-LIMIT  from core and moved to  Blocks  library
Removed 128-RAM bank switch  (BANK!)  from core in perspective to abandon all references to non-Next version
Fixed  SEE  to detect  ?DO  when on disassemble.
Fixed  BLEEP  and introduced  some BLEEP-CALC  and  BEEP-PITCH
Experiment on  MMU7  and corrections on  MOVE-SP,  MOVE-RP,  MOVE-LIMIT 
Experiment on  UPPER


\ build 20200628
Introducing  AUTOEXEC  for the first time 
Changed "name" to  "Next Forth" and removed references to Microdrive
Improving  MMU7  banking study using words  +FAR -FAR  FAR-HL and moved previous example of  FAR-HL  from screen #290 to #300 
Bakup of first 350 screens to 10001 onward.


\ build 20200702
Introduced a quick'n'dirty audible click on  KEY 
Word  BASIC  on returning to Basic, retuns the value currently on top-of-stack. Useful to return ORIGIN and make faster the rebuild.
Test on  AUTOEXEC  in core, run 1 LOAD. Useful at startup.
Verified and corrected words MOVE-SP; copied words MOVE-SP, MOVE-RP, MOVE-LIMIT to screen 225-227: useful to free MMU7 last 8K bank (D000-FFFF)
Introduced screen #100 to compile the whole ASSEMBLER (screens 101-162)


\ build 20200705
fixed  AUTOEXEC  in core, to correctly run 1 LOAD
Added NIP and TUCK to core.
SP register to be below C000 in  ?TERMINAL  and  KEY  too.
Fixed  RND  in !blocks.bin library and told Marcus Cruz to correct his GitHub's Afera library.
Improving MMU7 banking study using words  +FAR -FAR  FAR-HL, Moved previous example of FAR-HL from screen #290 to #300 
Finally fixed the Z80N  NEXTREG op-code  to use N, commaer instead of the duplicated V,
Experiment on  .RESET  to force a soft-reset.

\ build 20200714
Introducing case-insensitive vocabulary search (FIND)
Two new words CASEON to enable and CASEOFF to disable case-sensitive.


\ build 20200717
Removed a nasty bug: when you typed  LIT  alone, the system crashed.
Resolved adding a NOOP after EXECUTE in INTERPRET definition.
This shows how easily we can rebuild this system.


\ build 20200721
Fixed v-Forth name in spash screen.
Restored flashing cursor. Improved SEE.
Introduced CASEOFF and CASEON to accept lower-case input.


\ build 20200808
Introducing FAR address pointer based on MMU7.
System now starts with a write-only OPEN#13 stream attached to file "c:/FORTH/output.txt" text file to collect any output redirected to device #13 via some   13 SELECT   followed by some output word. See Screen#252 to see an example of it.
This release comes in two version 
- forth15a.bin : as usual
- forth15e.bin : with upper 8K RAM freed to experiment with MMU7.
